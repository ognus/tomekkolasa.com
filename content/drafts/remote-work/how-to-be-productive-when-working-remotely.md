title: How to be productive when working remotely
---

Being productive is a standard onsite office job is in itself a challenge, and working remotely is no exception. Not to say it’s always harder to be productive when working remotely, I think it’s often easier, but it definitely comes with its own set of challenges.

I have been working remotely for many years now and although I liked it from the get-go it took me some time to get the best out of it. I still struggle sometimes, but now I have a better understanding of what works and what doesn't, which lets me cope with my lazy and distracted mind more effectively. Let me share what I have learned over the years working from home.

What I found helped me a lot is making a schedule for when I'm working, having a dedicated place at home to work at, incorporating a morning routine, meeting with other devs face to face at least from time to time and sleeping well.

## Keep a schedule

When I started my first fully remote job in 2014 I didn’t know the significance of a schedule. Since I could do the work at any time, I ended up doing it literally at any time, scattered throughout the day, often starting some work in the morning and finishing it at night. Because of that I felt like always being at work, even though I just did normal working hours.

I was often working on Saturdays or Sundays as well. This is not necessarily a bad thing if that’s the schedule you decide on, but for me, every day was kind of different, unplanned, and reactive. Because of that I was wasting a lot of time. Not to mention all the mental energy to make decisions on what to do next, which often ended up with me changing my plan.

In psychology, this is called the [decision fatigue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_fatigue) which means that making many decisions throughout the day impacts are further decision making and drains us out. It makes it hard to stay productive.

I've also learned that I can achieve many more things when I use a schedule. There are many seemingly empty chunks of time during the day we could utilize. Even 10 min a day of learning a new skill would have a tremendous compounding effect after a year. 10 min is really nothing, so it feels like we got the skill for free. The difficult part is that our brain doesn't really spontaneously come up with an idea to do something useful for 10 min before we go to sleep or instead of watching one less episode on your favorite TV series.

That's where the schedule comes in. So we can plan and schedule what we want to achieve beforehand, when we feel motivated and productive. The remaining thing is to teach our lazy brain to try it's best to follow the schedule. That's where routine and habits help.

Benefits of keeping a schedule:

- use less mental capacity and avoid decision fatigue
- compact the time by removing layover time, so you end up with more free time
- achieve more things, and things you really care about

## Establish a routine

Predictable actions that start your day or proceed your work really tie back to the idea of habit forming. You can put your mind at ease when it knows that familiar things are going to happen. If you always have your tea when you start working, sitting down to work when you prepared it would feel like natural progression, so your mind will be much less likely to freak out and come up with 100s of excuses why now it's not a good time for work.

Log the time you log and work less than 8h

Whether or not you would like to enjoy the full potential of flexibility that remote work gives you, I would like to really encourage you to log your time, so you know how many hours you worked per day and week. There are several benefits in doing that.

Benefits of keeping a schedule:

- easier to start the work
- helps to follow your schedule and achieve goals

## Log your time

Logging time helped me a lot in being productive in general, especially when working at odd hours. Because of it, I always know if by the end of the week I'm running behind and I can push a bit more on Friday or catch up during the weekend or I've already worked enough. This is also useful during so-called "crunch time" when we work overtime to finish the work before the deadline. Sometimes it happens we would work as much as possible for a week or two, but even then it's useful to see how much more I have worked, because after the such a push, there naturally comes a dip and if you can see that pattern over and over, you don't feel guilty that you're not as productive as usual for the next week or two after the crunch mode.

That also made me realize that overtime is not really increasing the overall output, it's more like borrowing that adding time. Sure, it's sometimes needed to make the deadline, but relying on it is not a good long-term strategy.

Crunch mode is a failure in planning, and should be treated as such, it will happen, but we should learn from it to avoid it next time, it's not a solution or strategy.

Benefits of logging your time:

- flexible working hours
- overtime under control

## Sleep well

When you are constantly sleep-deprived, even a little bit, but over a long time, things are still possible, but everything takes much more mental energy. I'm just not my usual self when sleeping for less than 8h. I can still do work, but I'm much more distracted, I'm not generally happy about my work and I make more mistakes. Maybe sleeping fewer hours works for some people for some time, but I don't believe you have to wake up at 4 am and go to sleep at midnight to be successful. It's all about what you do with your time when you're awake.

I think it's super helpful to manage your sleep well and is not that obvious how. At least it wasn't for me. Things like how much sleep we need, the sleep quality, what time best to go to bed. Well, it's generally better to have at least 8h of sleep opportunity, go to bed earlier then stay up late etc. but I'm far from being able to give advice on this topic and I'd encourage you to do some research. Personally, I can recommend the book [] which helped me improve my wellbeing and productivity.

Benefits of sleeping well:

- sharper mind and feeling intrinsically motivated
- better mood and general level of happiness
- you get sick less often


## Be healthy

You know, the usual... no junk food, no smoking, no booze, and exercise. The usual generic advice that it's kind of obvious by now, but not really at all helpful. I try to eat a bit better, and I make myself do some exercise. Unsurprisingly it helps, and it helps quite a bit. What I have learned though, is to be open-minded, and give something new a try. I have never liked sports too much, I did some running and martial arts before, but never liked it that much. Recently I've given Olympic lifting a try and even though it's hard and I never will be good at it (my shoulder is buggered and I don't practice often enough) I really enjoy having it a part of my life.

## Have a dedicated space for work

Dedicated space for work really helped me a lot. It's not like I didn't have a place to work at when I first started working for home. I had a desk with a chair, and a second screen I connected to my laptop. But it wasn't really a space that I mostly dedicated to work. I've watched movies there, browse social media etc. It was also always super cluttered with print outs, paper clips, letters, pens, and just random stuff.

The key is to have a space that feels like productive work, not a cluttered mess with a computer you use for anything else. Otherwise it's really hard to separate work for pleasure and your brain is constantly nudging you to watch some silly crap on YouTube instead of doing work. 

It doesn't have to be perfect as well. It doesn't have to be a separate office room with an adjustable standing desk and gaming chair etc. Those things would definitely help, but what's crucial is that you feel good in that place and your mind associates it with work and being productive. Familiar setting is great for calming down your brain and focussing, if left running wild we tend to come up with excuses to do something else then work.

## Change it up

Although a pleasant workspace setup at home is very important, it doesn't mean we have to always work from home. At at least the same part of your house or apartment, as with the recent situation some of us are pretty much stuck for home. Personally, I prefer to work from home anyway, so the recent situation hasn't really changed much for me even though my current company was renting a co-working space, I always have used it sporadically.

If you have a laptop try working from different places at your home. I really like the couch, although I need to be careful to not feel too comfortable and fall asleep. On nice days I think it's a great idea to try working from your garden, patio or veranda. Or, if you live in an apartment like me, just open up your balcony doors and stick yourself out with your laptop as much as comfortable. Does it really count as working outside? I guess so...  

Sometimes, however, when I don't feel like working or doing anything productive I force myself to go and work from somewhere else. So I really hope I'd be able to do that again sooner than later. I usually enjoy places like cafes (well... it's usually just Starbucks, to be honest) or public libraries. If you don't think cafes are a good idea, try coworking spaces when it will be safe again. There are most likely some cheap or free coworking spaces in your city, so have a look.

## Socialize

We geeks are inevitably humans, and as humans, we really are social beasts. [citation about social contant] Even hardcore introverts need a contact with other like-minded people to feel positive.

Attend conferences, meetups and discussion groups so you can feel inspired and energized. There is also more and more happening online, so make sure not to miss those opportunities as it's very important to maintain some social life in this difficult situation. At my work, we had an online drinking party last week to celebrate the launch of our new product. It was different than a face to face meeting, but definitely enjoyable. Try it out.
