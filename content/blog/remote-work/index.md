title: How to be productive when working remotely
---

I have been working mostly remotely for many years now and although I really liked it from the get go I took me some time to get the best out of it.
Being productive is standard onsite office job is in itself a challenge, and working remotely is not exception. Not to say it’s harder to be productive when working remotely, I think it’s actually easier for many people, but it definitelly comes with it’s own set of challenges. 

What I found helped me a lot is making a schedule for when I'm working, having a dedicated place at home to work at, incorporating a morning routine, meeting with other devs face to face at least from time to time and sleeping well.

## Keep a schedule

When I've started my first fully remote job in 2014 I didn’t really know (or rather felt) the significance of a schedule. Since I could do the work at anytime, I ended up doing it literally at anytime, scattered through out the day, often starting something in the morning and finishing at night. Because of that I felt like always being at work. With some breaks obviously, sometimes few hour long ones, which is nice, but then I always tried to catch up at night and often got a feeling of working all day long, even though I just did normal 6 - 8h day.

This reactive, instead of preactive practice of mine usually extended over the weekend. I was often working on Saturdays or Sundays to take other days off. I didn't really work too well for me, but I really like the liberty of not taking days off, asking someone about day off, so I tried to keep the liberty, but figurate a better plan. The answer was better planning and logging time.

 One time I’ve tried working less hours per day but for 7 days a week. I think it lasted for several weeks. Explore and find what works for you best. TODO: 25h sleep cycle

This is not necesairly a bad thing if that’s the schedule you decided on, but for me, everyday was kind of different, unplanned, and really reactive. I could do so much more in a day worth of work then that.





Most of my remote gigs didn’t require any particular schedule, with the exception of meetings and status updates that really varied between jobs. 
When working remotely, 

LOG you TIME

Sleep well

Dedicated place

Socialize
We geeks are an inevitably humans, and as humans, we really are a social beasts. [citation about social contant] Even hardcore introverts need a contact with other like-minded people to feel positive.
Attend conferences, meetups, so you can feel inspired and energized.  

Routine

Log the time you log and work less then 8h
