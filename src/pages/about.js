          <h1>Hi, I'm Tomek.</h1>
          <p>I‚Äôm a full-stack engineer from Poland. </p>
          <p>I currently work and live in Tokyo, Japan.</p>
          <p>
            I started coding over 15 years ago and I don‚Äôt feel like stopping. I
            enjoy building web and mobile apps in React.js and React Native,
            building APIs in Node.js, and constructing cloud infrastructures in
            AWS and GCP.

      <h2>About the blog</h2>
      <p>
        This blog is a deep dive into a full-stack JavaScript ecosystem. Topics
        ranging from frontend development through backend and finally DevOps. I
        believe that familiarizing yourself with all aspects of software
        development will tremendously improve the outcomes of your work.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also write about non-tech challenges we face as software developers,
        especially related to productivity and remote work. Let‚Äôs face it, ‚Äúreal
        life‚Äù sometimes gets in a way of coding. If you want to be a great
        developer, you have to learn how to deal with it.
      </p>

      <p>I work hard to create quality articles on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>JavaScript </li>
        <li>Node.js </li>
        <li>TypeScript </li>
        <li>RESTful and GraphQL APIs design </li>
        <li>Cloud Computing (deployment, CI/CD, containers) </li>
        <li>remote work </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        I do really hope you will find some of my articles useful or interesting
        üòÄ
      </p>

      <p>So feel free to let me know what you need. I am here to help you.</p>

      <p>
        What‚Äôs in it for me? You might ask. Well, first of all, I do like
        explaining things, and I really like to dive deeply into the topics,
        that‚Äô how I learn best. I hope blogging would allow me to do just that.
      </p>

      <p>
        I would also like to improve my technical writing skills, and writing in
        general. I hope it will come easier once I get better at it.
