## Hi ðŸ˜Š

This is the repo for tomekkolasa.com blog.

Topics ranging from frontend development through the backend, DevOps, and finally remote work and productivity.
I believe that familiarizing yourself with all aspects of software development will tremendously improve the outcomes of your work.

I work hard to create quality articles on:

- JavaScript
- Node.js
- TypeScript
- RESTful and GraphQL APIs design
- Cloud Computing (deployment, CI/CD, containers)
- remote work

I do really hope you will find some of my articles useful or interesting.

So feel free to let me know if there is something you'd like to read about, would like to collaborate or simply to leave feedback.

## Contributing
